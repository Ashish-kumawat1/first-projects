Weather App - Weather App

Overview:
A simple client-side weather dashboard focused on Indian cities. The app displays current weather information (temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and a "feels like" value), a 5-day forecast area, and an interactive India map with city markers. It uses OpenWeatherMap for weather data (note: API integration is suggested but implementation may depend on `script.js`).

Files:
- weather App.html  -> Main HTML file containing layout and map markers.
- script.js         -> JavaScript for fetching weather data and updating the UI (see file for implementation details).
- style.css         -> Styles for the app UI.

How to use:
1. Open `weather App.html` in a web browser (double-click or open via your editor).  
2. Enter an Indian city name in the search box and click "Search" (requires `script.js` to be wired to a weather API).  
3. Click city markers on the map (if `script.js` supports marker clicks) to view that city's weather.

Notes and setup:
- The app references Font Awesome via CDN for icons. Ensure you have network access for icons to load.
- If `script.js` uses OpenWeatherMap API, add your API key in `script.js` as directed by the script's comments. Protect your API key; for deployment use a server-side proxy or environment variablesâ€”do not commit secret keys to public repos.
- This project is a static client-side demo. To make it fully functional across devices consider hosting on GitHub Pages or any static hosting provider.
