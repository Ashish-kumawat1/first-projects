Task Management

Overview:
A minimal client-side Task Management (To-Do) app demonstrating a simple UI for creating, viewing, and managing tasks. It includes an index HTML file, styles, and client-side JavaScript for task CRUD operations stored in browser localStorage.

Files:
- index.html  -> Main HTML file with the app layout and UI elements.
- script.js   -> JavaScript handling task creation, editing, deletion, and persistence.
- style.css   -> CSS styles for layout and responsive behavior.

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser (double-click or open via your editor).
2. Use the input field to add new tasks and press Enter or click the add button.
3. Edit or delete tasks using the controls next to each task (if implemented in `script.js`).
4. Tasks persist in the browser using localStorage; clearing browser data will remove saved tasks.

Notes:
- The app is purely client-side and requires no server to run.
- For cross-device sync or multi-user support, integrate a backend API and user authentication.
